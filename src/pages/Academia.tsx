                    This course dives deep into physical product development and prototyping, building on ideation skills. You'll learn about various prototype types—Proof of Concept, Looks-like, Works-like, and Engineering Prototypes—and how to select the best methods and materials based on factors like cost and time. The course emphasizes iterative testing to meet stakeholder needs, balancing form and function throughout the product development lifecycle, from Product Requirements to Mass Production, while also considering aspects like Design-for-Manufacturing and intellectual property.
