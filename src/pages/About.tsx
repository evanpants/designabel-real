                    <p>
                      I have 20 years of experience bringing innovative products to life. As a mechanical engineer and MBA who founded three companies (two acquired), I've driven product and operations excellence at VC-backed startups and Walmart alike. I'm comfortable bringing complex ideas to scale.

                      <p>
                        I've developed hundreds of innovative products, ranging from a hand mixer and folding colander to an ingenious car seat/stroller and a countertop frozen yogurt machine. I'm equally comfortable uncovering user needs and prototyping as I am sourcing manufacturing partners, optimizing assembly lines, and writing quality assurance plans. I also teach Product Development at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering.

                      <p>
                        I've managed digital product development including websites, customer-facing apps and communications, internal team tools, and KPI reporting systems. I led multidisciplinary teams - design, copy, frontend and backend developers, data, QA - and coordinated with operations, marketing, and the C-suite to align with business goals.

                      <p>
                        At Walmart and The Rounds, I focused on improving the customer experience across the entire journey, with the understanding that today's customers and markets will evolve. Building robust business strategy means understanding market trends, user cohorts, behavioral psychology (i.e. willingness to pay and convenience), competitors, regulation, and compliance. I align teams around shared goals to balance current product releases with long-term innovation - essential for building a sustainable competitive edge.
